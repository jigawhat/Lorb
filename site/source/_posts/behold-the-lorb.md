## Behold The Lorb

Forged in the depths of crystal crusted caverns close to core of the Runeterra, this newly discovered energetic glowing orb can apparently tap into the invisible life-force energy occupying space around living organisms in order to foresee the outcome of immenant battles taking place in the general proximity. Many speculate that it was originally created by a race of ancient aliens many millenia ago, and that contained deep within the ethereal and mesmerizing flitters of energy is a magical superintelligence.

But one question still eludes illumination regarding the discovery. Why had this relic appeared now? Was there some sort of arcane conflict of balance occuring somewhere on Runeterra, to which the orb has a directive to respond to?

Stay tuned.
